# myCurrencyApp
My Currency Converter is a simple app, that allows you convert currencies to EUR.
It is possible to add, amend or delete currencies.
It has backend (Java) and frontend (Javascript) files.
This is backend file for my Currency Converter app.
All data is stored in database. I used Maria db and HeidiSql for my poject. If you clone my project, you should have database named "currency" created in your SQL database.
For creating this project I used Spring Framework with Gradle.
